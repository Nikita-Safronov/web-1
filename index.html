          How to Cook Pizza
      </h2>
      <p>
          Gather your ingredients: one baking sheet, one sheet of tin foil, one pizza crust, one jar of olive oil, 
          one utensil to spread the aforementioned olive oil, shredded cheese, and toppings of your choice.  Preheat 
          the oven to the temperature specified on the packaging of the pizza crust.  Pour a bit of the olive oil onto 
          the pizza crust, and use the utensil to spread the olive oil across the pizza crust until it is evenly distributed.  
          Distribute your toppings evenly atop the pizza crust.  Pour an amount of cheese atop the pizza.  Place the pizza in 
          the oven for the amount of time specified by the packaging of the pizza crust.  Remove the pizza from the oven.

      <h2>
          How to Cook Pasta
      </h2>
      <p>
         Gather your ingredients: one stove, filtered tap water, one pot, one plate or one bowl, one strainer, and one package of pasta.  
          Fill a pot about halfway with filtered tap water.  Place the pot on the stove and turn on the stove to medium heat.  When the 
          water begins to boil, add the pasta to the water for the time specified by the packaging of the pasta.  Then, turn off the stove.  
          Pour the pasta from the pot into a strainer, and transfer it into a plate or a bowl.

      <h2>
          How to Cook Grilled Cheese
      </h2>
      <p>
          Gather your ingredients: one pan, a small amount of butter, one plate or one bowl, one utensil for flipping the bread, one slice of bread, 
          and one slice of cheese.  Place the butter into the pan.  Place the pan on the stove and turn on the stove to medium heat.  When the butter 
          melts, place the bread into the pan.  When the side of the bread facing the pan becomes golden and crispy, flip the bread.  Add the cheese to 
          the top of the bread.  When the other side of the bread becomes golden and crispy, turn off the stove and transfer the grilled cheese into a 
          plate or a bowl.
